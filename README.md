# Go, App Engine, and Bootstrap templates

Quickstart project for Google App Engine with Go SDK and Bootstrap themed templates.

## Overview

More details and suggested use are available in the original article here: [Nested Templates with Golang](https://www.m0d3rnc0ad.com/post/go-gae-bootstrap-quickstart/)

## What it looks like

The [demo page](http://bootstrap.m0d3rnc0ad.appspot.com/), shows the ability to render templated pages inheriting all the Bootstrap components: ![Example Components](https://d2q4nobwyhnvov.cloudfront.net/fa935a8b-146b-4237-b5ef-39d6b31bb892/vl-i83CzEKueHyw/images/go-gae-bootstrap-quickstart/showcase.png)

## Getting the code

In addition to checking out this git repo, you can fetch the project with ```go get``` and immediately run it locally:

```bash
> go get github.com/TheAndruu/Go-App-Engine-Bootstrap-Quickstart

> cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TheAndruu/Go-App-Engine-Bootstrap-Quickstart

> goapp serve
```

Navigating a browser to `localhost:8080` then displays the welcome page!
